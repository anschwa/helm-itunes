Helm iTunes
===========

Search and play your music with iTunes or Spotify from inside Emacs.

# Usage

`M-x helm-itunes` and search for either a song, artist, or album in your iTunes 
library.

(The search begins after youâ€™ve typed at least 2 characters. You can use space-separated terms for psuedo-fuzzy matching.)

`M-x helm-itunes-player` to play songs through Spotify instead of iTunes.

# Status
Ready to use.

Currently only supports OS X.

### Bugs:

- Song tittles with parenthesis or non-alphanumeric characters will sometimes not play.

- Each search is somehow being repeated, causing iTunes to open and close various times.
