;; Package-Requires: ((helm "1.6.1"))

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; A search & play interface for iTunes and Spotify.
;;
;; You can search for either a song, artist, or album.
;;
;; Bugs:
;; - Symbols in song titles will sometimes prevent the song from playing
;; in iTunes. Tracks are "percent-encoded" when played through Spotify,
;; so they do not have this problem.
;; - iTunes will open and close various times upon a search.
;;
;; Currently only supports OS X.
;;
;; Inspired by helm-spotify: https://github.com/krisajenkins/helm-spotify
